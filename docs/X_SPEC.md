# X Spec for Patois Launch

## Positioning
"The internet, but in Patois."

## Content pillars
1. Before/after screenshots of popular websites
2. Funny translated lines
3. Mini language/culture snippets
4. Build-in-public updates (shipping logs)

## Launch plan (7 days)
- Day 1: Teaser post + waitlist/repo link
- Day 2: Demo clip (Google News in Patois)
- Day 3: Feature thread (toggle, intensity, local-only privacy)
- Day 4: Community prompt: “Drop a site for translation”
- Day 5: Meme-style reactions + quote RTs
- Day 6: Changelog screenshot
- Day 7: Recap thread + next features poll

## Tone
Sassy, playful, high-energy. Never disrespectful.

## Draft templates
### Teaser
I built a Chrome extension that turns regular websites into Patois 🇯🇲

Internet needed more flavor. So I fixed it.

### Demo
Just translated [site name] into Patois and now everything reads 3x funnier.

Should I open-source this today?

### Build update
Shipped: toggle + intensity + local-only processing.

No tracking. No login. Just vibes.
